# Slots

We launched a new way for you to interact with your embeds, they're called Slots!

Slots are a way for you to have permanent browser sources from Ping, and be able to hot swap who goes where in your broadcast. This feature is great for those who leverage nested scenes, have different guests on your broadcast, or run a show where you need to move guests around mid-broadcast.

## Setup in Ping

To get started, lets make our first Embed in the Embeds Window on the right-hand side of your call

We'll go ahead and name this Embed like something like *"Guest"*, this will be our Embed slot that we use to rotate a new guest into our show every week.

Now when we have our guest join our call on Ping, we'll click on the Embed Menu icon on their video and add them to Guest.
