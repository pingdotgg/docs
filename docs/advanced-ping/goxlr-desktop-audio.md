- Side note, if your guests can hear themselves in the playback, make sure that whatever you’re using to hear them (Discord or Google Chrome) is being sent to “Chat” in Windows
  - You can get there by Right Clicking the Volume Icon in the bottom right of the system tray, then going to Sound Settings, then going to “App volume and device preferences”
