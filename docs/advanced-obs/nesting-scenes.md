# Nesting Scenes

Nesting scenes is a great hack that not tons of people know about in OBS. This allows you to change one source across many different scenes with one action.

We'll go through an example of how Nested Scenes can help in a simple collaborative Scene Collection, and use Ping.gg as our source that we'll be swapping out.

## Setup

First we'll make some scenes
 - Interview
 - Interview w/ Screen
 - Buffer (Optional, but a great way to keep your scenes organized)
 - This Weeks Guest

In "This Weeks Guest", all we are going to add is a Browser Source from Ping!
